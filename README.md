# TypeScript Coding Tasks

A collection of tasks to solve using TypeScript and TDD (Test Driven Development). Test cases are included for each task.

Happy hacking :)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To get up and running, you will need the following tools.

#### Code

To write and test code you will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed. If your on a Mac, use [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) for installation.

```
brew install node
brew install yarn
```

Will also need [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) installed.

```
npm install -g typescript
```

### Installing

Change to the root directory and install required packages.

```
yarn
```

## Running the tests

Tests can be run globally from the root directory by running `yarn test`

```
yarn test
```

## Using the Repository

Switch to the folder of your chosen task and run the tests `yarn test`. All tests will fail in their initial state. Your job is to write code that makes all the tests pass.
